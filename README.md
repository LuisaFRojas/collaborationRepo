# collaborationRepo
Collaboration is key to success, if you need someone to practice your skills with: WELCOME! 

This repository is a free reign and not controlled-owned by a particular member. Please be mindful of this. The purpose of this repo is to collaborate with each other to improve our current technicall skills. That being said, there are some basic rules :
1. In order to support organization and avoid conflicts, please create a directory with your name. You are welcome to create any sort of framework-structure within your directory (NOT OUTSIDE). This will also give you ownership of everything under that directory (This means you will need to support and maintain it).
2. In order to merge changes done to your local repo: Allow at least one other person to review your PR, this is where the collaboration really happens.
3. In the spirit of improvement, there will be challenge posted in the "COMMON" directory. Feel free to create your own challenges and create PRs with the challenge (class) name. Everyone that decides to accept the challenge MUST create a PR within their personal directory. Remember: there is always 151687982002.3252658302 ways to do the same thing!
4. Please use the "Discussions" tab for any communication, questions, suggestions etc. 
5. If you have any questions, reach out!
6. That. Is. It. 

Happy coding!
